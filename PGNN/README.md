# Poisson-Gamma Neural Network.
## Deep Neural Networks for Clustered Count Data via Hierarchical Likelihood

This repository contains the source code and data files associated with our paper submission for NeurIPS 2023.

This is the working directory for our NeurIPS 2023 paper submission.

* The `PGNN.py` file includes the source code for training the Poisson-gamma neural networks, which presents the main findings of our paper.

* The `NNNN.py` file contains the source code for training neural networks with mixed effects. This model was previously introduced in ICML 2023 and is included here for comparison purposes.

* The `data_generator.ipynb` file provides the code for generating the simulation data used in our experiments.

* The `simulation.ipynb` file contains the code for running the simulation experiments and obtaining the corresponding results.

* The `data_analyses.ipynb` file includes the code for performing analyses on real data.

Please refer to the relevant files for more detailed information on each component.
